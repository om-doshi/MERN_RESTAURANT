A Restaurant Reservation Form is a simple form used by customers to book a table at a restaurant in advance. It typically collects key details like the customer's name, contact information, reservation date, time, number of guests, and any special requests or preferences. This form helps restaurants manage seating, ensure availability, and provide a smoother dining experience for their guests.
